# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Your Breakdown Here
1. Update Agents table
    - Add a column agent_custom_id (Alpha Numeric) on Agents table
    - time estimate: 30 min
    - acceptance criteria: agent_custom_id should be of type varchar(5), unique and not null

2. Modify save agent functionality
    - When saving details for an Agent, the facility should capture the agent details with agent custom id.
    - time estimate: 1 hour
    - acceptance criteria: The system should throw an error if the agent custom id is not captured

3. Update getShiftsByFacility
    - In the function "getShiftsByFacility", join the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables to return data with agent_custom_id instead of the auto generated primary key id for agent metadata
    
        Example: 
        
        SELECT 
            S.name as shift, S.start_time, S.end_time, 
            A.agent_custom_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
            F.name as facility
        FROM Shifts S 
        JOIN Agents A ON S.agent_id = A.id
        JOIN Facilities F ON A.facility_id = F.id
        Where F.id = ${facility_id}

    - time estimate: 30 min
    - acceptance criteria: Returned data must have agent_custom_id

4. Update generate report function
    - Update the "generateReport" to replace autogenerated agent id with the agent_custom_id, the data on the report should be inclusive of the facility name, agent details like first and last names, and shift details like when it started ad ended. 
    - time estimate: 30 min
    - acceptance criteria: Agent details must have agent_custom_id instead of the auto generated primary id
